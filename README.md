# React-To-Do-List
Created with CodeSandbox

To-Do-List created with Reactjs.

The main goal of this assignment was to use hooks to get the functionality of the app working. I was able to do so by creating a useState for each list Item and for the array that stores all items. Each time a new item is added, that item gets added to the items array through the set function with the spread operator. The items aray is then rendered with hooks. Using the map function, each item is rendered as it's own individual List item component with a name property equal to the item.
